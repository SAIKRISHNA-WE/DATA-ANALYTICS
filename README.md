# DESCRIPITION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMED AND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND PASTE PICTURES OF OUTPUT:For this task, I performed analysis on a large dataset using PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework. I began by setting up the PySpark environment and loading a large CSV dataset to demonstrate scalability. Data cleaning and preprocessing were carried out using Spark DataFrame operations. I utilized transformations like filtering, grouping, and aggregating to extract key insights from the data. The distributed nature of PySpark allowed me to handle millions of records efficiently. I derived business insights such as top-performing categories, time-based trends, and anomalies in data, and visualized them using matplotlib for clarity. The entire workflow was maintained in a Jupyter Notebook with proper documentation and code comments.
